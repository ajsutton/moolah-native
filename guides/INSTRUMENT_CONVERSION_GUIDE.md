# Instrument Conversion Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Platform targets:** macOS 26+ (primary), iOS 26+ (secondary)

## 1. Architecture Overview

Moolah is multi-instrument by construction: accounts, legs, earmarks, and positions are all expressed in an `Instrument` (fiat currency, stock, or crypto token), and a profile has a single `profileInstrument` that user-facing totals roll up into.

**Key types:**

- `Domain/Models/InstrumentAmount.swift` — `InstrumentAmount { quantity: Decimal, instrument: Instrument }`. All arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`) has a `precondition` that the two operands share an instrument and **traps** on mismatch. `Comparable` (`<`) compares raw `quantity` only and does NOT guard instrument equality.
- `Domain/Services/InstrumentConversionService.swift` — the only sanctioned conversion API:
  - `convert(_ quantity: Decimal, from: Instrument, to: Instrument, on: Date) async throws -> Decimal`
  - `convertAmount(_ amount: InstrumentAmount, to: Instrument, on: Date) async throws -> InstrumentAmount`
- `Shared/PositionBook.swift` — the canonical aggregation primitive. Per-instrument positions are kept as raw `Decimal` keyed by `Instrument` and only converted at read time in `dailyBalance(on:…)`.
- Production conversion implementations: `FiatConversionService` (Frankfurter API), `FullConversionService` (fiat + stock + crypto).
- Test doubles: `FixedConversionService` (ignores date), `DateBasedFixedConversionService` (honours date).

**Hard constraint:** Frankfurter does NOT return future exchange rates. For anything at or after today, the "latest available" rate — requested with `Date()` — is the documented best estimate.

**Key Sources:**
- `plans/ROADMAP.md` Phase 6 — multi-currency intent.
- `plans/2026-04-17-forecast-currency-conversion-plan.md` — forecast date rule and the crash this codifies.
- `plans/completed/2026-04-12-multi-instrument-design.md` — foundational design.

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Arithmetic crashes; conversion throws.** A mismatched `+`/`-` traps the process. A failed conversion throws and is recoverable. Convert *before* summing across instruments.
2. **Aggregate per-instrument, then convert.** Keep per-instrument positions as raw `Decimal` keyed by `Instrument`. Convert to a target instrument at the edge (read time), never in the middle of accumulation.
3. **The conversion date is a semantic choice.** It must reflect *when the value is denominated*, not when the code runs. Historic = snapshot date; current/future = `Date()`.
4. **Single-instrument fast path.** When a position's instrument equals the target, skip the conversion service entirely and add the raw quantity. Do not route same-instrument data through an async call.

## 3. Rules

### Rule 1: Never add `InstrumentAmount`s that may differ in instrument

`InstrumentAmount.+/-/+=/-=` `precondition` both sides share an instrument. A mismatch is a crash, not an error. If inputs can come from different instruments, convert first.

```swift
// WRONG: legs may be in different instruments on a multi-currency profile
let total = transaction.legs
  .map(\.amount)
  .reduce(.zero(instrument: profile.instrument)) { $0 + $1 }  // traps

// CORRECT: pre-convert each leg to the target instrument
var convertedLegs: [InstrumentAmount] = []
for leg in transaction.legs {
  if leg.instrument == profile.instrument {
    convertedLegs.append(leg.amount)
  } else {
    convertedLegs.append(
      try await conversionService.convertAmount(
        leg.amount, to: profile.instrument, on: transaction.date))
  }
}
let total = convertedLegs.reduce(.zero(instrument: profile.instrument)) { $0 + $1 }
```

### Rule 2: Reduce seeds must match every element

`reduce(InstrumentAmount.zero(instrument: X)) { $0 + $1 }` is only correct when *every* element of the sequence is in `X`. Reduce over a collection produced by an explicit conversion step, not over raw domain data.

### Rule 3: `max`, `min`, and `<` across instruments are nonsense

`InstrumentAmount: Comparable` compares raw `quantity`. It does NOT guarantee the instruments match, and it does NOT trap. 10 USD < 1 BHP.AX compares `10 < 1` and returns `false`. Only compare amounts that are provably in the same instrument. Convert first if needed.

### Rule 4: Clamp after conversion, not before

Per-earmark sums are clamped to `>= 0` *after* conversion in `PositionBook.dailyBalance`. Applying `max(…, .zero(instrument: X))` to a running sum whose instrument may disagree with `X` is both a crash risk and semantically wrong.

### Rule 5: Historic data uses the snapshot date

Any read whose semantics are "as of this date" must convert on that date. This includes:

- Daily balances (`fetchDailyBalances`, `computeDailyBalances` historic entries).
- Transaction list display amounts (`Transaction.buildWithBalance` uses `transaction.date`).
- Expense breakdowns and income/expense totals (per-transaction conversion).
- Historical reports, tax summaries, capital-gains calculations, and any chart whose x-axis is time.

```swift
// CORRECT: convert each leg at its transaction's date
let converted = try await conversionService.convertAmount(
  leg.amount, to: targetInstrument, on: transaction.date)
```

### Rule 6: Current-value reads use `Date()`

Reads whose semantics are "what is this worth right now" must convert on today:

- Sidebar totals, net worth, available funds.
- `InvestmentStore.valuatePositions` (current valuation).
- `AccountStore` rollups used by the sidebar and account detail.
- "Current" earmark availability shown to the user.

### Rule 7: Forecast and scheduled use `Date()`, not the future date

Frankfurter has no future rates. Converting on a scheduled transaction's future `date` will either fail or silently return the wrong value. Convert extrapolated scheduled instances on `Date()` before they enter the forecast accumulator.

```swift
// WRONG: future date, no rate exists
let converted = try await conversionService.convertAmount(
  leg.amount, to: profile.instrument, on: scheduledInstance.date)

// CORRECT: today's rate is the documented best estimate
let converted = try await conversionService.convertAmount(
  leg.amount, to: profile.instrument, on: Date())
```

See `plans/2026-04-17-forecast-currency-conversion-plan.md` for the full rationale.

### Rule 8: Single-instrument fast path

If `instrument == target`, skip the conversion service and add the raw quantity directly. This keeps single-currency profiles off the network/cache path.

```swift
for (instrument, quantity) in positions {
  if instrument == target {
    total += quantity                                          // fast path
  } else {
    total += try await service.convert(quantity, from: instrument, to: target, on: date)
  }
}
```

### Rule 9: Use the semantic observation date, not wall-clock metadata

Use `transaction.date`, `dailyBalance.date`, `snapshot.date`, or the explicit parameter the function advertises. Do NOT use `createdAt` / `updatedAt` / record metadata timestamps — those reflect *when the user wrote the data*, not *what the data is denominated on*.

### Rule 10: Keep `startOfDay` consistent

The date used to key a balance and the date supplied to the conversion service must both be normalized the same way (usually `Calendar(identifier: .gregorian).startOfDay(for:)`). Mismatches can cross timezone boundaries and return yesterday's rate for today's value.

## 4. Canonical Patterns

### Per-instrument accumulation, then convert at read time

`PositionBook` keeps `[UUID: [Instrument: Decimal]]` and converts in `dailyBalance(...)`. New aggregation code should adopt the same shape rather than accumulating `InstrumentAmount` across mixed instruments.

### Pre-convert into a typed carrier

`ConvertedTransactionLeg { leg: TransactionLeg, convertedAmount: InstrumentAmount }` — the type itself carries the guarantee that `convertedAmount.instrument` equals the target. Reducing over `[ConvertedTransactionLeg]` is safe by construction.

### Conversion-service seam

Every call site that needs a rate goes through `InstrumentConversionService`. This keeps the date decision and the fiat/stock/crypto dispatch in one place. Do not call `ExchangeRateService`, `CryptoPriceService`, or `StockPriceService` directly from a feature-level store or view.

### Single-instrument fast path

See Rule 8. Applies to both `convert(_:from:to:on:)` and `convertAmount(_:to:on:)`.

## 5. Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Do This Instead |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Summing `TransactionLeg.amount` directly across legs | Legs are per-instrument; multi-currency profiles crash | Convert each leg, then sum (Rule 1) |
| `reduce(.zero(instrument: X)) { $0 + $1 }` over raw domain data | Seed instrument doesn't match elements in multi-currency data | Reduce over a pre-converted collection (Rule 2) |
| `max(a, b)` / `a < b` on `InstrumentAmount`s of unknown instrument | Compares raw quantity silently; 10 USD < 1 BHP.AX is false | Convert to a common instrument first (Rule 3) |
| Clamping `max(sum, .zero(instrument: X))` before conversion | Traps when `sum.instrument != X` | Clamp after conversion (Rule 4) |
| Historic reports calling `.convert(..., on: Date())` | Report values drift from the authoritative historic rate | Pass the snapshot/transaction date (Rule 5) |
| Sidebar/net-worth calling `.convert(..., on: someHistoricDate)` | Shows a stale rate as "now" | Pass `Date()` (Rule 6) |
| Forecast converting on the scheduled future date | Frankfurter has no future rates; throws or returns wrong value | Convert on `Date()` (Rule 7) |
| Routing same-instrument data through the conversion service | Unnecessary async hop and network/cache traffic | Fast-path when `instrument == target` (Rule 8) |
| Using `createdAt` / `updatedAt` as conversion date | Metadata timestamp is not the semantic observation date | Use `transaction.date` / `dailyBalance.date` (Rule 9) |
| Keying balances and converting rates with un-normalized `Date` | Timezone drift — "today's rate" for yesterday's balance | Normalize both with `startOfDay` (Rule 10) |
| Test coverage only via `FixedConversionService` (date-ignoring) | Cannot detect wrong-date regressions | Use `DateBasedFixedConversionService` for date-sensitive tests |
| Constructing `InstrumentAmount(quantity:, instrument:)` with an implicit running-total instrument | Assumption breaks when inputs differ | Keep positions as `[Instrument: Decimal]` until convert time |
| Calling `ExchangeRateService` / `CryptoPriceService` / `StockPriceService` directly from a store or view | Bypasses the `InstrumentConversionService` seam and the fast path | Always go through `InstrumentConversionService` |

## 6. Review Checklist

### For every change that touches monetary aggregation

- [ ] Every `InstrumentAmount.+/-/+=/-=` operates on operands provably in the same instrument.
- [ ] Every `reduce(.zero(instrument: X))` reduces over a collection whose elements are provably in `X` (ideally a freshly pre-converted array).
- [ ] Every `max` / `min` / `<` on `InstrumentAmount`s compares values provably in the same instrument.
- [ ] Clamps, ceilings, and floors are applied *after* conversion to a known target instrument.
- [ ] Single-instrument fast path is present where the accumulated data could be same-instrument in a common user setup.

### For every change that touches conversion dates

- [ ] Historic reads (daily balances before today, transaction lists, expense/income breakdowns, tax summaries) convert on the snapshot/transaction date.
- [ ] Current-value reads (sidebar, net worth, available funds, investment valuations, account detail) convert on `Date()`.
- [ ] Forecast/scheduled paths convert on `Date()`, never on a scheduled transaction's future date.
- [ ] Date is the semantic observation date (`transaction.date`, `dailyBalance.date`), not wall-clock metadata (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
- [ ] Date used to key a bucket matches the date handed to the conversion service (same `startOfDay` normalization).

### For every new conversion call site

- [ ] Goes through `InstrumentConversionService`, not a lower-level price/rate service.
- [ ] Single-instrument fast path present.
- [ ] Test coverage uses `DateBasedFixedConversionService` if date correctness matters.
- [ ] Failure path — a throwing conversion — is surfaced to the user or logged, not `try?`-swallowed.
