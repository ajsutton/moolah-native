/// Tests construct an ephemeral `URLSession` whose `protocolClasses` lists
/// this stub, so requests stay scoped to the test's session — calling
/// `URLProtocol.registerClass(_:)` is unnecessary and skipped.
///
/// Intentionally non-`final` so SwiftLint's `static_over_final_class` rule
/// doesn't apply to the inherited overrides. `URLProtocol` already declares
/// its own (unavailable) Sendable conformance, so the subclass can't add a
/// new one — `nonisolated(unsafe)` on the static handlers map is what
/// actually keeps Swift 6 strict concurrency happy here.

  /// fixture-loading tests use disjoint host/path keys, so there is no
  /// shared mutable state at the test boundary.
